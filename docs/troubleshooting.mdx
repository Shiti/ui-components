**Q: Using the `CodeSnippet` component in my project gives me the error below. What should I do?**

```
Uncaught (in promise) Error: Unrecognized extension value in extension set ([object Object]).
This sometimes happens because multiple instances of @codemirror/state are loaded, breaking instanceof checks.
```

A: If you are using webpack, follow these steps to resolve it:

1.  Update `webpack.config.js` with the code below

```
resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@codemirror': path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/@codemirror/'),
    }
  },
```

Make sure to add `const path = require('path')` at the top of the file if it's not already there.

2.  You might need to remove the node_modules directory and package-lock.json file from your project directory and reinstall the dependencies.
