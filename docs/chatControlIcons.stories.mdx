# Chat Control Options

The chat control options are a set of interactive buttons that allow users to perform various actions on messages within a chat interface. These options provide users with functionalities to engage with messages in different ways, such as editing, copying, and deleting.

The examples of chat control options are shown in the `MessageCanvas` and `MessageSpace`'s stories. Users can import the necessary components and integrate them via the `getActionsComponent` props. Keep in mind that the `getActionsComponent` props must always be a single React element and can be composed of several control options supported for the message. Below are the available control options along with their accepted fields:

## Copy

Only supports copying text from text message.

Fields:

```
message: ThreadableMessage
```

## Other Control Options

Additional control options are currently under development.
